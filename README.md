The Markdown Guide for the Perplexed
====================================

The **markdown-guide** project is a collection of reviews, tutorials, documents, and scripts relating to markdown — in all its different flavors — and the existing tools to work with it.

This is the *Moreh Nevukhim* (מורה נבוכים) of all markdown seekers.

This project is maintained by Tristano Ajmone (aka T.Ajmonides), it was created in December 2016, and its title is a witty homage to the great _Rambam_.
